## HTML & DOM Implementation

1. **HTML Parser Robustness**: Your HTML parser handles basic tags and structure, but you could improve:
   - Better error recovery for malformed HTML
   - Support for more HTML5 elements and attributes
   - Implementation of custom elements
   - Support for shadow DOM

2. **DOM API Completeness**: Implement more DOM methods like:
   - DOM mutation observers
   - Full event propagation (capturing and bubbling phases)
   - Complete selector API (querySelectorAll with complex selectors)

## CSS Implementation

1. **CSS Parser Enhancements**:
   - Support for more complex selectors (combinators, pseudo-classes)
   - CSS animations and transitions
   - Media queries
   - Flexbox and Grid layout algorithms
   - CSS variables

2. **Style Resolution**:
   - Better cascading and inheritance handling
   - Support for !important rules 
   - Computed value resolution for more properties

## JavaScript Integration

1. **Event Handling**:
   - Complete event system (bubbling, capturing, preventDefault)
   - Event delegation
   - Standard DOM events (click, mouseenter, etc.)

2. **DOM API Bindings**:
   - More comprehensive DOM API exposed to JavaScript
   - Standard Web APIs (setTimeout, fetch, localStorage)
   - Better error handling and exception propagation

3. **Performance**:
   - Optimize JavaScript object creation/garbage collection
   - Use of WeakMap/WeakRef for DOM node references

## Layout Engine

1. **Layout Algorithms**:
   - Full implementation of block formatting context
   - Inline formatting context (line breaking, text layout)
   - Flexbox and Grid layout models
   - Table layout algorithm
   - Float and positioning improvements

2. **Performance**:
   - Incremental layout for better performance
   - Layout caching
   - Layout optimizations (avoid unnecessary calculations)

## Rendering

1. **Graphics Implementation**:
   - Replace ASCII rendering with actual graphics
   - Use a proper graphics library (Cairo, Skia, or direct GPU rendering)
   - Text rendering with proper fonts
   - Image rendering

2. **Render Features**:
   - Compositing layers
   - Hardware acceleration
   - Clipping and masking
   - Opacity and blend modes

## Networking

Your networking components are mostly empty placeholders. Key implementations needed:

1. **HTTP Client**:
   - HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support
   - TLS/SSL for HTTPS
   - Connection pooling
   - Header handling and cookies

2. **Resource Loading**:
   - Asynchronous resource loading
   - Resource prioritization
   - Cache implementation
   - Content-type handling

## Additional Components

1. **UI Integration**:
   - Window creation and management
   - Scroll handling
   - User input (keyboard, mouse events)
   - Context menus

2. **Browser Features**:
   - History API
   - Bookmarks
   - Developer tools
   - Security features (CSP, CORS implementation)

3. **Performance & Testing**:
   - More comprehensive test coverage
   - Benchmarking tools
   - Profiling tools for performance optimization

## Next Steps

If you want to focus on making the browser more functional, I recommend prioritizing:

1. Networking support (to actually load web pages)
2. Complete the rendering system (replace ASCII with graphics)
3. Enhance layout to support more complex layouts
4. Improve JavaScript integration with more DOM API bindings
